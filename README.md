# This project is archived.
## The implementation of this module has been moved to device-tree, which no longer requires installation on the vast majority of released ROMs.
## However, if the new ROM (with oss kernel, most ROMs after lineage-23.0 release for ingres) doesn't support triggers, there's no point in installing this module, as vendor_dlkm won't have the required module anyway.
